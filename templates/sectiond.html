      <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="img">
      <img src="Images/vs.ico" alt="Hot boi"></div>

    <p>Visual studio code by Microsoft is an open source software that allows user to use various programming language
      in it such as python, java or html and is available on various platforms such as windows, Linux as well as macOS.
      We are using this software for various reason such as it is having GitHub integration as well as supporting html,
      CSS, and JavaScript. Visual studio code is free to use software and the version for this project will be version
      1.48, and there is a lot of html editors that we could of such as sublime text 3 but, visual studio code was
      easier to use by everyone. </p>

      <h2>LucidChart</h2>

    <div class="img">
      <!--LOGO LINK:https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/solutions/sales-->
      <img src="Images/lc.jpg" alt="Hot boi"></div>

    <p>Lucid chart is a web-based software that allows users to draw visuals such as concept drawings, how systems work
      such as database and is free to use with a subscription fee. The group decided to use this since we needed to make
      some concepts for user interface design before making the real thing. lucid chart is covered for student for RMIT
      meaning the whole group has access to the pro model thereby any alternative such as draw.io will not be as useful
      as the free version will not have as many features the group might want</p>

      <h2>GitHub</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="img">
      <!--LOGO LINK: https://github.com/logos-->
      <img src="Images/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="Hot boi"></div>

    <p>Git hub is a software that allows user to host their own software on their site and give users version controls
      as well as many features that allow for collaboration. We are using this tool as it will allow all our group
      members to contribute their own code to the project as well as its version control feature making it easier to
      revert to an older version if something goes wrong. There are Alternative such as Source Forge, but we are not
      using that as the group is not familiar with the software.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="img">
    <!--Logo Link: https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-etrhj-->
    <img src="Images/off3.png" alt="Hot boi"></div>

  <p>Microsoft office includes a variety of things such as words, excel and teams which will be used for a variety of
    things such as writing to planning and having group meeting, and we are going to need it since it has good
    collaboration features which we would need to use since we will be doing a lot of planning, discussing and
    scheduling. The software is covered for student, so it is free and alternatives to it is google suite, but it is not
    as advanced as Microsoft option. </p>

  <div class=user_name>
    <h2>Outline of the specific process for dealing with unmet expectations or other problems that might arise.</h2>
    <p>Roles wonâ€™t be too specific to team members and we can easily swap roles if we need to so if a unwanted situation
      occurs there will be at least 1 team member who is knowledgeable but if one group member who is knowledgeable in
      area were to not show up we will prioritise on that area until the group members shows up again, and if it is
      something technical such as the internet going off or a computer is broken, we have backup plans such as spare
      laptops and mobile hot spots.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=user_name>
    <h2>An agreed-upon method for peer feedback during the project so that problems can be addressed before the project
      ends.</h2>
    <p>For peer feedback the group has decided to have a weekly rating system for monitoring a group members
      participation and progress and each group members will give a short description on what a group member did well
      and did not do well in.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=user_name>
    <h2>Describe the expected frequency of responses.</h2>
    <p>The expected frequency of response will be daily as we will need to contact each other via messaging to let group
      members know about progress and something a group member might have trouble with. When doing face to face meetings
      online the frequency will be weekly once or twice to have a deeper discussion about progress and areas we need to
      improve on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class=user_name>
    <h2>Describe how you use tools in the context of the weekly workflow.</h2>
    <p>We will be constantly using Microsoft teams on a weekly basis to communicate with each other, and Microsoft words
      to write down descriptions or plans we might have for the project. We will also using Microsoft excel to write
      down dates and times for project that have a specific due date and will use GitHub to upload different version to
      GitHub when making changes.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
  </div>

  <p>The workplace our group will collaborate is many such as GitHub which will allows us to iterate on our project and
    track version, and everyone has access to it. We will also be using Microsoft teams to communicate with each other
    via recorded video call or via chat to update or seek help about the project and everyone has access to Microsoft
    teams. Another software we will be using it Trello which will allow us to organise our projects with the use of
    board and track where each of the group members is at and is doing and our whole group has access to the tool and is
    already assigned a task to do. Another tool is AWS that the group is going to use that will allow us to host our
    final website. Currently at this stage only 2 members of the group are familiar with its use thereby making it
    something that needs to be taught to the entire group very soon.</p>
