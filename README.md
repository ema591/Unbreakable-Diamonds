# Unbreakable-Diamonds

## Important
1. Please make sure to add commit the changes in your branches instead of directly to the master branch. Then open a Pull request and leave it open. As sometimes commiting directly to master can turn out to be problematic. 
2. In order to integrate the html files with the backend we need to put all of the html files in the templates folder. 
3. The css file along with all of the images/videos /etc/etc should be stored in the static folder.

## Front end To do

1. Add a questions.html, quizzes.html.
2. Add jinja to the html (the params passed in are on the same line as render_template). The variable `form` is used to access the entire object with `form.username.label` being the label and `form.username` being the string field. /etc/etc
