         <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>Email: S3796563@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
          
          <p>I'm Post-graduate in business administration, passionate about working in multi-cultural teams. I have had Experience as manager, working in small, mid and large sized companies and
             Interested in business consulting. I have a Lack of coding experience that can improve and am Aiming to develop programming skills and new work methodologies. i am in need of improving 
             my habit of Low productivity working from home/online and am not prepared for setting an efficient schedule while tasks are not face-to face. The area that some of my team members percive as weakness varies
             for Emma it is her programming skills and time management while for Julian it seems to be his overall time management or motivation, while Ahnaf could improve on his communication skills, and Theo
             seems to also have a lack of motivation while Siddhesh has probleams with completing deadlines on time while Wilson could work on communication and showing up for group meetings. some challenges i could face is the use of
             coding languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, as I have no previous experience and i see my self contributing to the team in Ideation, layout creation and the actual programming aspect
             so i could improve these skills and challenge myself.  </p>

              <p>Email: s3812428@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
              
              <p>I don't have	a detailed background in IT but one in science (Bachelor of Biomedicine Major in Cell and Developmental Biology) and
                 Currently am interested in learning more about website design, HTML, CSS etc. My strong points would be â€“ attention to details. Strongest point would be HTML in terms of IT but still learning to code. Interested in website design for IT, 
                 biology/sciences and arts crafts outside of IT and my weak points would be in	HTML, CSS, Java/JavaScript. My other team members weakness would be low productivity when working from home for Theo
                and for Julian it is that he might not get things done on time and for Ahnaf it would be communication and for Wilson is participating and contributing to the team and Siddhesh would be completing deadlines on time. When assigned a task I could see myself doing is coding some of the html and CSS for the website because it is relatively easy to learn. 
                Also researching and collecting data is something I could also do.</p>
