    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Email: S3796563@student.rmit.edu.au </p>

    <p>I'm Post-graduate in business administration, passionate about working in multi-cultural teams. I have had
      Experience as manager, working in small, mid and large sized companies and
      Interested in business consulting. I have a Lack of coding experience that can improve and am Aiming to develop
      programming skills and new work methodologies. i am in need of improving
      my habit of Low productivity working from home/online and am not prepared for setting an efficient schedule while
      tasks are not face-to face. The area that some of my team members perceive as weakness varies
      for Emma it is her programming skills and time management while for Julian it seems to be his overall time
      management or motivation, while Ahnaf could improve on his communication skills, and Theo
      seems to also have a lack of motivation while Siddhesh has problems with completing deadlines on time while
      Wilson could work on communication and showing up for group meetings. some challenges i could face is the use of
      coding languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, as I have no previous experience and i see my self contributing
      to the team in Ideation, layout creation and the actual programming aspect
      so i could improve these skills and challenge myself. </p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Email: s3812428@student.rmit.edu.au </p>

      <p>I don't have a detailed background in IT but one in science (Bachelor of Biomedicine Major in Cell and
        Developmental Biology) and
        Currently am interested in learning more about website design, HTML, CSS etc. My strong points would be â€“
        attention to details. Strongest point would be HTML in terms of IT but still learning to code. Interested in
        website design for IT,
        biology/sciences and arts crafts outside of IT and my weak points would be in HTML, CSS, Java/JavaScript. My
        other team members weakness would be low productivity when working from home for Theo
        and for Julian it is that he might not get things done on time and for Ahnaf it would be communication and for
        Wilson is participating and contributing to the team and Siddhesh would be completing deadlines on time. When
        assigned a task I could see myself doing is coding some of the html and CSS for the website because it is
        relatively easy to learn.
        Also researching and collecting data is something I could also do.</p>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>s3854666@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
        <p> I am a first-year student interested in cyber security. I did my high school and 1 semester of university in
          Adelaide and transferred over. I enjoy automating very simple stuff in python and I find that very
          interesting. I also like playing capture the flag games. There are things I would like to Improve on such as
          how to plan for industry projects and expand my knowledge to learn more about how computers work
          and Hopefully, I will also develop my communication skills by collaborating with different people
          to make a project that everyone is happy with. Many team members have expressed some things that they are weak
          in and could improve up on
          such as Ahnaf needing to expand his knowledge in CSS and Theo needing to get more motivated while Julian being
          able to do things in a deadlines
          and Emma needing to expand on her HTML skills while Wilson could be more communicative. Some challenges i
          might face would be in this project will be building the ideas that we come up with in real life as in the
          previous projects I've only come up with ideas without making them. I would help the team by contributing to
          the website development part and a part of the project where we might talk about security.</p>

          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>s3844976@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

          <p>I currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT university. My background is Italian My
            main hobbies include playing games such as counter strike global offensive and rocket league on PC. I also
            play basketball and AFL in my free time either at home or at a park. My main interests in IT is cyber
            security as I find their methods of defending and attacking interesting, also take interest in programming.
            A strong point would be that I work hard when given a task. Something that interests me is the cyber
            security sector.One of my weak points would be that I leave things to do until the last minute so I could
            probably work on my time management and try to get this project done the day before its due. Each group
            members seem to
            have a weakness such as Emma needing to improve her coding skills, Theo needing to improve his time
            schedule, Siddhesh learning how to
            deal with stress, Ahnaf working on his time management and Wilson needing to attend group meetings on time.
            I would help the team by contributing to the website development part and a part of the project where we

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>s3842928@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

            <p> I'm a First year RMIT student currently doing the bachelor of I.T originally from New Zealand and moved
              to
              Australia where I finished year 12. Been interested in I.T since high school particularly in robotics and
              coding as well as having a slight interest in web development. My strong points are that i Have a basic
              knowledge of web programming and know how to use many programs useful to a teamwork environment such as
              GitHub and Microsoft teams and have many interests such as cars and video games, but also robotics and
              machine learning. My weak points would be Designing aspects as well as using programming languages such as
              java or python that I could work on as well as further improve my knowledge of CSS so I would like to work
              on design and CSS to improve my skills. Some weakness other members of my group perceive are that Julian
              tends
              to not fulfill his deadlines which is a similar cases fot Theo but that stems from him not being motivated
              this semester
              while emma believe she could improve on her coding skills and Siddhesh seems to be stressed easily which
              could impact his performance
              and Wilson could improve on his concentration and commitment. Some challenges for me are Implementing
              features that
              are more complex and finishing advanced features such as the chat bot for the Covid app as well as
              finishing all my task before the deadline. Task i would like to do are hosting the teams website as well
              as
              developing parts of the website with HTML and CSS and work with one of the group members to implement a
              design for the website as well as work on the chatbot
            </p>
